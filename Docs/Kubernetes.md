# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a popular container orchestrator and it has been released in 2015 by Google. Kubernetes runs on top of Docker (usually) as a set of APIs on containers it then provides API/CLI to manage containers across servers. Many clouds provide kubernetes for you but there are also vendors that make a 'distribution' of it.
